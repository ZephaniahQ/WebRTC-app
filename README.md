# webrtc_app

This code is inspired by this medium article: https://medium.com/@sanjaysharmajw/flutter-webrtc-484848f47ac0
Which I believe this is a fix for this GitHub repos code: https://github.com/md-weber/webrtc_tutorial.

I plan to build additional features and smooth out the rough edges in the original.

The motivation for making this app was to demonstrate WebRTC's low latency for a Computer Networking presentation
where I compared it to other protocols like RTMP/RTSP and HLS through live demos
