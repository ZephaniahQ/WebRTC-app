# webrtc_app

This code is coppied from this medium article: https://medium.com/@sanjaysharmajw/flutter-webrtc-484848f47ac0
which I beleive is a fix on this github repos code: https://github.com/md-weber/webrtc_tutorial.
I plan to build aditional features and smooth out the rough edges for my own applications.

I started work on this for a Computer networks presentation in my Unviersity to showcase different media streaming protocols and compare them.
However I had been interested in webRTC long before that while trying to stream video from my android-arduino robot to my laptop for computer vision.
Now that I have a working app I will make some changes and implement this on the bot.
